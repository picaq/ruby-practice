# Classes and Modules

## Classes

### Class Definition

- singular nouns
- capital camel case `ShoppingCart`
- each class defined in separate file
- group classes in dir
- can be redefined or modified
  - add new changes without whenever
    
- Attributes = State
- Methods = behavior

### add attributes by defining them as custom methods in def
```ruby
class ShoppingCart
  
  # methods part of class template
  def quantity
    # ...
  end
  
  def total
    # ...
  end
  
end

```
